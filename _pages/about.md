I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at McGill University supervised by Prof. [Mathieu Blanchette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_Blanchette_(computational_biologist)). I will join Data Science and Analytics Thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as an assistant professor. I received my bachelor's degree from the City University of Hong Kong. Prior to studying McGill University, I worked as an research assistant (intern) at Indiana University, and the City University of Hong Kong. For more information, please check my CV.

Research
======
My research focuses on developing and applying computational methods (i.e., algorithmic and machine learning approaches) for interpreting complex biological data sets. This includes:
1. Developing deep learning and statistical inference approaches to analyze and comprehend 3D genome organization.
2. Developing and tailoring representation learning algorithms to analyze biological data sets.
3. Developing and applying computational tools to analyze omics data (i.e., population genetics, cancer genomics, and MS/MS proteomics).
