I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at McGill University supervised by Prof. [Mathieu Blanchette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_Blanchette_(computational_biologist)). I will join Data Science and Analytics Thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as an assistant professor. I received my bachelor's degree from the City University of Hong Kong (2015). Prior to studying at McGill University, I worked as a research assistant (intern) at Indiana University (2013-2014), and the City University of Hong Kong (2015-2017). For more information, please check my [CV](https://github.com/zhyanlin/zhyanlin.github.io/blob/master/files/Yanlin_CV_Aug.pdf).

<span style="color:red"> Openings: I have multiple [fully-funded](https://fytgs.hkust-gz.edu.cn/admissions/before-submitting-an-application/scholarships-fees) Ph.D. positions (Spring/Fall) and research assistant/intern positions available at HKUST(GZ). </span> In particular, I am looking for students who are interested in computational biology and machine learning to work in the following directions:
* Computational 3D genomics
* Physics-informed GNN for 3D genome modelling
* Interpretable machine learning for (epi)genome data analysis
* Representation learning approaches in biological data analysis

Please contact me by email with your CV, transcripts, publications (if any),  motivation letter (required for shortlisted Ph.D. applicants), and research proposal (optional).

Research
======
My research focuses on developing and applying computational methods (i.e., algorithmic and machine learning approaches) for interpreting complex biological data sets. This includes:
1. Developing deep learning and statistical inference approaches to analyze and comprehend 3D genome organization.
2. Developing and tailoring representation learning algorithms to analyze biological data sets.
3. Developing and applying computational tools to analyze omics data (i.e., population genetics, cancer genomics, and MS/MS proteomics).
