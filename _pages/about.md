I am a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on computational biology and applied machine leanring. I obtained my PhD training at McGill University under the supervision of Prof. Mathieu Blanchette. I will join Data Science and Analytics Thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as an assistant professor. I received my bachelor's degree from the City University of Hong Kong (2015). Prior to studying at McGill University, I worked as a research assistant (intern) at Indiana University (2013-2014), and the City University of Hong Kong (2015-2017). For more information, please check my [CV](https://github.com/zhyanlin/zhyanlin.github.io/blob/master/files/Yanlin_CV_Aug.pdf).

<span style="color:red"> Openings: I have multiple [fully-funded](https://fytgs.hkust-gz.edu.cn/admissions/before-submitting-an-application/scholarships-fees) Ph.D. positions (Spring/Fall) and research assistant/intern positions available at HKUST(GZ). </span> In particular, I am looking for students who are interested in computational biology and machine learning to work in the following directions:
* Computational 3D genomics
* Data integration via multi-modal learning
* Interpretable machine learning for (epi)genome data analysis
* Representation learning approaches in biological data analysis

If you have a degree in physics or similar programs and want to do research in computational biology and machine learning, you can also contact me to discuss possible options in the following directions:
* 3D genome modeling (i.e., Physics-informed GNN for 3D genome modeling, etc.)

Please contact me by email with your CV, transcripts, publications (if any),  motivation letter (required for shortlisted Ph.D. applicants), and research proposal (optional).

Research
======
My research focuses on developing and applying computational methods (i.e., algorithmic and machine learning approaches) for interpreting complex biological data sets. This includes:
1. Developing deep learning and statistical inference approaches to analyze and comprehend 3D genome organization.
2. Developing and tailoring representation learning algorithms to analyze biological data sets.
3. Developing and applying computational tools to analyze omics data (i.e., population genetics, cancer genomics, and MS/MS proteomics).
