I am an assistant professor at the Data Science and Analytics (DSA) Thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on computational biology and applied machine learning at McGill University under the supervision of Prof. Mathieu Blanchette. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the City University of Hong Kong.

<span style="color:red"> Openings:</span> 

1. <b>PhD:</b> I have multiple [fully-funded](https://fytgs.hkust-gz.edu.cn/admissions/before-submitting-an-application/scholarships-fees) Ph.D. positions (<b>Fall 2025</b>) available at HKUST(GZ). I am particularly looking for students with a strong background in machine learning, such as LLMs, multimodal models, federated learning, etc., to work with me in the following directions:
* <b>Large DNA/RNA/Protein models</b>
* Data integration via multi-modal learning
* Computational 3D genomics

2. <b>RA/Intern:</b>  We have openings (on-campus only) for research assistant/intern positions focusing on topics related to AI4Biology. Please email me if you are interested in joining.

3. <b>RBM Students:</b> If you are an RBM student who wants to work with me in computational biology, feel free to drop by my office.

4. <b>Students at HKUST(GZ):</b> If you are a student at HKUST(GZ) and want to do research with me, have a quick chat, or learn about computational biology, you are welcome to drop by my office.

Please contact me by email with your CV, transcripts, publications (if any), motivation letter (required for shortlisted Ph.D. applicants), and research proposal (optional).

Research
======
My research focuses on developing and applying computational methods (i.e., algorithmic and machine learning approaches) for interpreting complex biological data sets. I have an increasing interest in developing large models for biology. This includes:

* Developing deep learning and statistical inference approaches to analyze and comprehend DNA sequence and 3D genome organization.
* Developing and tailoring representation learning algorithms to analyze biological data sets.
* Developing and applying computational tools to analyze omics data (i.e., population genetics, cancer genomics, and MS/MS proteomics).
* Developing and applying LLM and applications in bioinformatics.
